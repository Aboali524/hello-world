        <h1>Contract Agreement</h1>
        <p>I, Ahmad Alhomair, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall Semester 2023 web115 with my instructor, D.I von Briesen.</p>
        <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
        <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. <span class="signature">Signed: Ahmad K. Alhomair, 21 August 2023.</span></p>
